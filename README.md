# Advanced Task Manager Dashboard

A Python-based Advanced Task Manager Dashboard application built using `PyQt5`, `psutil`, and `pyqtgraph`. This application provides a graphical interface to monitor and manage system processes in real-time, displaying CPU, memory, and disk usage stats, and allowing process management.

## Features

- **System Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of system resource usage such as CPU, memory, and disk utilization.
- **Process Monitoring**: View active processes with details like PID, process name, status, CPU usage, and memory usage. The process list can be filtered by name.
- **Process Termination**: Select and terminate processes directly from the dashboard.
- **Real-Time Graphs**: Visualize CPU and memory usage over time with live-updating graphs.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for processes by name.
- **Intuitive UI**: Modern, dark-themed interface with resource-hungry processes highlighted.

## Requirements

- `PyQt5`: For creating the graphical user interface.
- `psutil`: To fetch system resource data and manage processes.
- `pyqtgraph`: For real-time graph plotting.
